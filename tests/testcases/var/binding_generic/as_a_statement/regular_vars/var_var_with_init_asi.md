## Input

`````js
var foo = bar
var zoo;
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in five parsing modes: sloppy, sloppy+annexb, strict script, module, module+annexb.

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
ast: {
  type: 'Script',
  webCompat: true,
  directives: [],
  leafs: [
    {
      type: 'VariableStatement',
      declarations: [
        {
          type: 'VariableDeclaration',
          binding: { type: 'BindingIdentifier', name: 'foo' },
          initializer: { type: 'IdentifierReference', name: 'bar' }
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      type: 'VariableStatement',
      declarations: [
        {
          type: 'VariableDeclaration',
          binding: { type: 'BindingIdentifier', name: 'zoo' },
          initializer: null
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}


`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Sloppy mode with AnnexB

Parsed with script goal with AnnexB rules enabled and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal with AnnexB

Parsed with the module goal with AnnexB rules enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
